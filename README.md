    This is my personal project website where I will
    display my photography and the projects I made.

## Home
    The main page of my website will feature a very 
    simplistic display of some of the photos I have 
    taken through the years in a mostly chaotic organization.

## Sudoku
    Features a game of sudoku that allows users to edit which 
    symbols are used for the game.
    I made this so I could practice Japanese kanji by using them 
    instead of the default numbers.

#### Page components:
    * Sudoku Board.
    * Number Legend.

#### In progress:
    * Control buttons:
        - Edit symbols.
        - Set symbols to Japanese numeral kanji.
        - Set symbols to default 1-9 numerals.

#### Backlog:
    * Numbers entered by the user will have a different color.
    * When selecting a symbol (on board or legend) all the
        instances of that symbol on the board will be highligted.
    * Timer.
    * Control buttons:
        - Hint.
        - Undo last move.
        - Eraser.

## Conjugator:
    Allows the user to conjugate a verb 
    in the Italian Present Indicative form. 
    I made this to help my friends practice 
    conjugate verbs in Italian.

#### Page Components:
    * TBD

#### In Progress:
